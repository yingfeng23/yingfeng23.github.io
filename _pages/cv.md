# Professional Experience

**Science for America** (2023-present)  
_Scientist, STEM_

**Biobot Analytics** (2019-2023)  
_Founding Staff Data Scientist (Nov 2022 - present)  
Founding Technical Lead, Data Science (Dec 2021 - Nov 2022)  
Senior Data Scientist (Mar 2021 - Dec 2021)  
Data scientist (Jul 2019 - Mar 2021)_  

As an early employee of Biobot Analytics, I've worn many hats and done many things:

- **Data science**: Analyze SARS-CoV-2 and opioid data from thousands of wastewater samples to gain public health insight (pandas, geopandas, scikit learn, scipy). Build data visualizations to communicate data concisely (matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas, altair). Work with other data scientists to build and launch data science features that make wastewater data more interpretable and actionable.
- **Technical leadership**: Define data science priorities and lead a team of internal data scientists, consultants, and academic collaborators to build statistical models to interpret SARS-CoV-2 and opioid metabolite concentrations in sewage. Work with company leadership to develop Biobot's data science strategy and roadmap.
- **Science communication & customer success**: Communicate Biobot's science through customer webinars, blog posts, and academic publications. Support customer success team to answer customers' technical questions.
- **People management & team building**: manage teams of 1-2 junior data engineers, 3-4 senior data scientists, and 2-3 junior data analysts. Establish consistent and successful hiring processes, and build the data science organization from 1 person to over 15 across three subteams. Establish & foster a positive and collaborative working culture.
- **Data engineering**: Design and build data processing pipelines (Python, snakemake, bash, Jenkins) to convert lab results into customer pdf reports. Collaborate with senior software engineers to migrate legacy pipelines to cloud-hosted infrastructure (AWS, lambda).
- **Technical architecture and design**: Design, build, and manage Biobot's database and processes (Airtable, zapier) supporting all company needs related to ordering, customer metadata, laboratory, and data management. Work with software engineering, product, and project management teams to migrate legacy systems to scalable and cloud-based technologies (AWS, postgres, APIs).  Write technical specifications and requirements documents for a variety of data science and software projects.
- **Project and program management**: Coordinate high-visibility, high-impact projects that touch many departments within Biobot. Lead internal technical workstreams and serve as an external technical point person for large federal contracts.

# Research experience

**Alm lab**, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2014-2019)   
*Under the direction of Eric Alm*

I did my PhD in [Eric Alm's lab](http://almlab.mit.edu/) at MIT.
You can learn more about my research interests on our [lab website](http://almlab.mit.edu/claire_duvallet.html) and on my [publications](/publications/) and [research](/research/) pages.
You can download my [thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/elvp8qzrz3zsjyx/duvallet_thesis_final.pdf?dl=0) and [defense slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j4b11wa8a4r42j8/2019-01-11.defense.pdf?dl=0), and also view them on my [github](https://github.com/cduvallet/phd-thesis).

**Molecular and Microscale Bioengineering Laboratory**, Columbia University (2011-2013)
*Under the direction of Samuel K. Sia*

I was an undergraduate research assistant in [Sam Sia](http://bme.columbia.edu/samuel-k-sia)'s lab for two years at Columbia.
There, I worked on developing a point-of-care microfluidic device to diagnose multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.
I primarily focused on the DNA amplification and detection modules, optimizing primers and reaction conditions off-chip.

**Laboratoire de Biochimie**, Ecole Polytechnique (Summer 2012)   
*Under the direction of Cedric Norais*

I was an international undergraduate research intern at Ecole Polytechnique the summer before my senior year.
There, I worked with Cedric Norais to study the acquired-immunity CRISPR system in E. coli.
