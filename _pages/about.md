I am a diligent and determined third-year Digital Marketing Ph.D. student, studying for my doctoral degree at Institute for Digital Technologies at Loughborough University, London campus. My research interests cover digital anthropomorphism, human-machine interaction, consumer psychology, and behavioural research. I have always maintained high academic standards whilst still participating in a range of research and teaching work. I also have strong interpersonal skills, and am detail-oriented and conscientious, which are attributes that allow me to work effectively in a team, or on my own.  

Before Ph.D., I received my Master of Research (MRes) Degree in Sport Business with Distinction from the Institute for Sport Business at Loughborough University. Before that, I studies BSc. Sport Ecnomics and Management at Beijing Sport University.
