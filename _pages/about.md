I am a diligent and determined third-year Digital Marketing Ph.D. student, studying for my doctoral degree at Institute for Digital Technologies at Loughborough University, London campus. My research interests cover digital anthropomorphism, human-machine interaction, consumer psychology, and behavioural research. 

Before Ph.D., I received my Master of Research (MRes) Degree in Sport Business with Distinction from the Institute for Sport Business at Loughborough University. Before that, I studies BSc Sport Ecnomics and Management at Beijing Sport University.
